# Cybersecurity-Projects-Portfolio
  Hi, I'm Adam Parman. I just jumped into the cybersecurity world in March 2024 and it has literally become my life since then. I completed a Professional certificate in Cybersecurity
  through Google's Coursera. I'm currently working on getting my CompTia Security+, I'm aiming to have it completed Jan. 2025. Anyway's I wanted to provide a way to show employers just what 
  I've been working on since completeing my first certificate and showcase some of my skills.
